# Web Portfolio
 
This web portfolio was meant to by my first venture into the world of computer science and web design. As you may be able to see, my code is specifically following the rules given in class, but some of my elements are not working functionally. I am not sure why but even after committing everything, github pages seems to not want to build my webppage accurately. I very much apologize for this and I will continue troubleshooting and figuring out what is wrong, but I am very sorry if I cannot because this is my first real work with computer science. I have never worked with HTML or CSS so this is all completely new to me so I am not really sure what I am doing wrong.
When I open the webppages from my computer and directly into the browser, it works but it does not seem to work through the GitHub Pages link. The visual argument page and the soundscape page do not show my link or image when you click on it for the github pages link and the about me is also not a link in the github pages website. I am not sure why this is happening but if you download my HTML files and click on each page, it works and has no issues. I am very sorry for this inconvenience I am not sure why this is occurring.
